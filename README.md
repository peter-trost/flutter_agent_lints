# flutter_agent_lints

Strict Dart and Flutter analysis options for codebases that are written mostly
by coding agents.

Every lint rule and analyzer diagnostic of the targeted Dart SDK is either
enabled as an **error** or explicitly disabled with a one-line reason. Nothing
is left at its default. The goal is to minimize the solution space: where the
language or the linter offers two ways to write something, exactly one is
allowed, and the analyzer enforces it instead of a reviewer.

## Install

```bash
dart pub add dev:flutter_agent_lints
```

```yaml
# analysis_options.yaml
include: package:flutter_agent_lints/analysis_options.yaml
```

The file works for Flutter apps and for pure Dart packages alike. Flutter
specific rules are inert when Flutter is not imported.

To opt into the rules the SDK still marks experimental (they can be renamed or
removed between SDK releases):

```yaml
include: package:flutter_agent_lints/experimental.yaml
```

## Principles

In priority order:

1. **Robustness.** Anything that prevents a class of bugs is on: unawaited
   futures, bare catches, dynamic calls, unclosed sinks, `BuildContext` across
   async gaps.
2. **One way to write it.** Single quotes, package imports, final locals,
   expression bodies, sorted members. Style is decided in the file, not in
   review.
3. **Token efficiency.** Types and keywords are required only where they carry
   information the compiler cannot derive. Local variable types are omitted,
   closure parameter types are omitted, doc comments are not mandatory.

## What the file contains

[`lib/analysis_options.yaml`](lib/analysis_options.yaml) is the whole product
and is meant to be read. It has:

- Strict language modes: `strict-casts`, `strict-inference`, `strict-raw-types`.
- Formatter pinned to the defaults (`page_width: 80`,
  `trailing_commas: automate`) so they are never a project-level choice.
- Excludes for generated files (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, and friends).
- Every stable lint rule of the SDK, alphabetically, as `true` or `false` with
  a reason.
- Everything that is on is an **error**, including every warning- and
  info-level analyzer diagnostic (`todo` too). An agent can ignore a warning;
  it cannot ignore an error.

The reason a rule is on or off sits next to the rule in the file. That is the
single source of truth; nothing here repeats it.

## Contributing

To propose a rule change, edit the rule's line in `lib/analysis_options.yaml`,
state the new reason in the comment, and regenerate `lib/errors.yaml`:

```bash
dart run tool/generate.dart
```
